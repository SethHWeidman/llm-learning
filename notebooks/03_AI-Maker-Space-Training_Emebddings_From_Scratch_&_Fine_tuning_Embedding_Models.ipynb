    "# Embeddings & You - A Brief Introduction to Embeddings in Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've toyed with LangChain, LlamaIndex, or even OpenAI's `ada` model - you've likely run into the word: \"Embeddings\" a few time.\n",
    "\n",
    "They've had a recent surge in popularity due to the profliferation of Retrieval Augmented Generation, but they've been around for a very long time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you come from an NLP background, embeddings are something you might be intimately familiar with - otherwise, you might find the topic a bit...dense. (this attempt at a joke will make more sense later)\n",
    "\n",
    "In all seriousness, embeddings are a powerful piece of the NLP puzzle, so let's dive in!\n",
    "\n",
    "> NOTE: While this notebook language/NLP-centric, embeddings have uses beyond just text!\n",

    "### Why Do We Even Need Embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to fully understand what Embeddings are, we first need to understand why we have them:\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning algorithms, ranging from the very big to the very small, all have one thing in common:\n",
    "\n",
    "*They need numeric inputs.*\n",
    "\n",
    "So we need a process by which to translate the domain we live in, dominated by images, audio, language, and more, into the domain of the machine: Numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing we want to be able to do is capture \"semantic information\" about words/phrases so that we can use algorithmic approaches to determine if words are closely related or not!\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we need to come up with a process that does these two things well:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert non-numeric data into numeric-data\n",
    "2. Capture potential semantic relationships between individual pieces of data"

    "\n",
    "**Skip-gram**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Skip-gram is an approach to teaching computers the meaning of words by predicting the surrounding context from a given word. Think of it as a student who learns by taking a single word and trying to guess what words might appear around it. For example, given the word \"sun,\" Skip-gram would learn to predict related words like \"bright,\" \"sky,\" and \"shine.\" This method is particularly effective at handling rare words in the vocabulary and capturing multiple meanings of words, though it typically requires more training time. The key insight is that words appearing in similar contexts often have related meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "CBOW takes the opposite approach to Skip-gram by predicting a target word based on its surrounding context words. Imagine playing a fill-in-the-blank game where you see \"The ___ is barking at the mailman\" and need to predict \"dog\" based on the surrounding words. CBOW looks at multiple context words at once and tries to understand what word would make sense in the middle. This method tends to be faster to train than Skip-gram and performs particularly well with frequent words in the vocabulary. However, it might not be as effective at handling rare words or capturing multiple word meanings since it averages the context."
