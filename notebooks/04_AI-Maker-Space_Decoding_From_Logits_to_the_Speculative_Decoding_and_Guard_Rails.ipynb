The first humans were thought by many people at that time (and still today) as being \"primitive\" or having no souls; they had only bodies with which their minds could communicate through touch alone.[1] However this view was quickly overturned when modern science began its study on human anatomy in earnest during the 19th century,[2][3]. It became clear over these centuries how much\n",

        "Top-P sampling, also known as nucleus sampling, is a text generation technique that provides a balance between diversity and quality in the generated text. It works as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Sorting probabilities**: After the model produces the probability distribution for the next token, the probabilities are sorted in descending order.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Cumulative sum**: A cumulative sum of these sorted probabilities is calculated.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Probability mass selection**: A threshold p (typically between 0.9 and 1) is chosen. The smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds p is selected.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Sampling**: The next token is randomly sampled from this reduced set of tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key advantages of Top-P sampling:\n",
        "\n",
        "- It adapts to the confidence of the model's predictions.\n",
        "- It can produce more diverse outputs than methods like Top-K sampling, especially for less confident predictions.\n",
